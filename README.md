# Fingerprint_Database_Generator
Problem Statement
The MITMEngine project (https://github.com/cloudflare/mitmengine) detects HTTPS interception and user agent spoofing by checking if the TLS fingerprint of an incoming connection corresponds to the expected fingerprint for the connectionâ€™s user agent. MITMEngine powers the MALCOLM dashboard (https://malcolm.cloudflare.com). The goal of this project is to use BrowserStack to generate TLS client hello fingerprints and user agents for a selection of recent browsers and store them in a Postgres database.
