# Fingerprint_Database_Generator
The MITMEngine project (https://github.com/cloudflare/mitmengine) detects HTTPS interception and user agent spoofing by checking if the TLS fingerprint of an incoming connection corresponds to the expected fingerprint for the connectionâ€™s user agent. MITMEngine powers the MALCOLM dashboard (https://malcolm.cloudflare.com). The goal of this project is to use BrowserStack to generate TLS client hello fingerprints and user agents for a selection of recent browsers and store them in a Postgres database.


## Steps
1- Install version 12.3 postgresql on Mac using: https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-sql-macos-setup

2- Create postgresql database with a table listing the http fingerprints, a table listing the tls fingerprints and a third table storing the matching of their respective ids. 

3- Create an account on BrowserStack (a free account would be enough for this project); automate browserstack for python using https://www.browserstack.com/automate/python.
